# Milestone 2: Prototyping and Heuristics - [Dress&Go]

## Storyboards
The storyboard represents a typical situation in which a common user may face renting clothes online.
Mark is searching for a very special t-shirt for its saturday party through the Dress&Go app on his smartphone, when 
suddendly a beautiful one appears on the diplay. 
Mark immediately likes the t-shirt and wants to rent this but he is dubious about the size, since it is from a brand he has never worn. Fortunately the app advises him with a size guide and finally Mark is convinced and decides to rent the t-shirt.
Some days later he finally receives the pack but after unpackaging it, Mark finds out that the t-shirt is all ruined.
He immediately gets angry and decides to consult the FAQ on the app in order to understand how to proceed.
After a very unfortunate chat with the vendor, Mark decides to call the customer service using the provided number and finally get the permission to print the label for returning the product.
Mark hasn't the t-shirt but is happy again.

We chose to represent this situation because it is a very common one and it is one of the most critical phases, during which the user needs to be assisted and everything should be as clear as possible. 
The user is helped by the app in this two phases: 
 - when he chooses the clothes to rent, in order to make it feel comfortable with different sizes from different brands, without any kind of doubt. In this way we try to solve a lot of problems reguarding sizes, because the user understands perfectly if the products are the right ones for him (reguarding the size); 
 - when he receives a product that, for some reasons, is not the right one for him (it can have defects but also maybe he simply doesn't like it). In this way we try to give to the user as much support as possible, in order to make him feel sure and protected when he rents something. 

Our goals were exactly these two ones, make the user more confident with different sizes and more protected in case of problems, so at this purpose is evident in the storyboard how the user can approach these two different problems and how he can solve them easily.

A possible weakness is that the user has to spend time talking with a third person in order to enable the return process or to solve further problems.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| *Return procedure* | *The user can manage all the know sizes inserted and add a new ones.* | *Pop-up to add a new well-know size of a specific brand.* |


In both of the two different protypes we tried to solve the problems emerged from the user needs. In particular, for the problem of the sizes we tried two different solutions: 
 - in the prototype 1 (P1) we add a size guide (5 in the screenshots) to let the user better understand if a product could be perfect for him or not, in order to misure a product of the same type (eg. a T-shirt) and find the right size for him.
 - in the prototype 2 (P2) we add a phase during the registration, in which the user can add some sizes of some products of some brands, in order to recognize them and have a better kind of suggestions in the ads list.       

This is evident in the first picture of the storyboard, in which the user wants to order a T-shirt and he tries to understand if it is of the right size using the guide. 

We also tried to solve the issue of a "problematic" order, in particular in both prototypes we add a green number that allows the user to contact a real person that can solve the problem (in addition of the FAQs and the possibility to directly contact the renter). In our scenario the customer service can solve the problem through a call and then can confirm the order (if the problem is not recognized) or unlock the return procedure, if the renter could not solve the problem. 
This is evident in the rest of the storyboard, in which the user receives an order that has problems, so he tries to read FAQs and to contact the renter but he cannot solve the issue, finallly, he calls the customer service that solves the problem and unlock the return procedure.  

## Heuristic Evaluation
The two prototypes consist of a succession of screenshots of a smartphone and were prepared in two different ways:
- P1: firstly, a cardboard phone was created to contain all the buttons useful for navigation; secondly, the paper screenshots are stuck on it.
- P2: each screen is a full-screen version of the smartphone and contains all the buttons useful for navigation;

The heuristic evaluation was conducted following the 10 Nielsen's Usability Heuristics. 
In particular, during and/or at the end of the evaluation each evaluator filled out the form in which the main problems of our prototype were highlighted.

At the beginning of the evaluation, we explained to the group **WASD** what our goal and our app idea are.
Furthermore, we made them read our project description. 
In this way, each evaluator would have the basis to better understand our requests.

|:--:|:--:|
| *Evaluation P2 (1)* | *Evaluation P2(2)* | 

In turn, one of our group held the role of facilitator and another one the role of computer.
In this case, the facilitator took pictures and notes during the evaluation, whereas the computer placed the different screenshots in the correct place and at the right time.

At the end, we asked the evaluator to navigate the app trying to reach certain goals
(for example, finding a white smoking, asking for information to the seller about the product etc.)

[The results obtained from the evaluations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-duovnkBdNNOAMF35bJrdteMy0mHqIqYwy8nUl7tsH8/edit#gid=1053447644) have been collected into a google spreadsheet containing:
- the legend of the rankings 
- two reviews given by the evaluators

From the evaluations obtained we decided to use the prototype number 2, 
integrating it with some features much appreciated by evaluators such as the bottombar and the size guide. 
In this way, we try to make the application clearer, simpler and more fluid.

The potential changes that we find useful are:
- seeing who is renting for example if it is a private or a shop, thanks to the issue number six (I6) of the first evaluator I1.
- allowing to review the renter, thanks to the issue number one (I1) of the first evaluator I1.
- seeing the cost of shipping on the product page, in order to highlight the different prices which combine to determine the total price.
- highlighting in different ways the status of the order (in "my order" section), for example adding small icons and giving a textual explanation of the status.
- giving the user the possibility to contact the customer service via chat instead of via phone number to solve the asymmetry with the way of contacting the renter.
- inserting a bottom bar that allows users to easily reach the main pages 
- adding an info icon that gives more informations about the features of the application, for example the meaning of the "Suggested by your sizes".
