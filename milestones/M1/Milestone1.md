# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: Dress&Go

## Overview and planning
Our idea is about helping people in clothes rental.
The population that we observed is composed by people (age included between 18 and 30) who are interested in this type of activity, to have a special outfit everytime needed.
The target groups are divided in: expert online user (has already had experience in online similar rental), expert rental user (has already had rental physical experience) and new user (never had experience in this kind of activities).
They must have a phone or tablet and they should know how to use it (e.g. to contact the customer care).
In order to analyze the same activity from different points of view, we select people that have already had experience in rental (physical or on-line) and vice versa.
People surveyed use this kind of service for different reasons, for example: to save money, to reduce the number of unused clothes, etc. 
We chose as main activity how the user deals with the arrival of a problematic order that doesn't respect the expectations.

## Observation
The interviewees were asked to tell a bad recent experience in rental clothes or to open the ordered package (we chose to report only the cases in which the user had problems with the content of the order).  

#### Observation: Primiano (M, 23, never had experience in online or physical rental or shopping simil rental and he doesn't like rental/buy used clothes)
Primiano ordered a Nike black t-shirt from Vinted, and he opened the box in front of us. He looked at the t-shirt and he suddenly noticed some inconsistencies, because the t-shirt was white instead of black, and the size was M instead of S. As first reaction he took the tablet and he searched in the app how he could solve the problem. He found the "Support" section and he read all the instructions to have a refund, not being able to ask for a change (things were used, vendor was a private).  
He has been redirected in the chat with the vendor and he has been forced to find a solution directly with him, sending photos and a description that demonstrated the problem. At this point the transaction was suspended, but due to a pop-up just above the keyboard that limited the writing and the reading of messages, he pressed the button "It's all ok" assuming that it means that the complaint was received, but in this way the order was confirmed and transaction has been accepted. He tried to send the complaint again, but it was too late, money has already been sent, so he decided to keep the black t-shirt without trying other methods to have the refund.

*Primiano-He pressed the wrong button due to problems with the graphic interface.*


#### Observation: Alex (M, 24, has experience in physical rental, specifically in the rental of carnival clothes)
Alex started telling us that he and his group usually rent carnival clothes for carnival float. They usually take clothes from referenced person for a fixed amount of time (can be months but also years).
Sometimes the person who rents tells clothes are perfect, but they arrive with defects (e.g. stained or unstitched). He tells that at the last carnival before Covid-19, they found few clothes in bad conditions, so they had to make a complaint. Indeed, probably people who rented them in the past hadn't taken care of clothes. When they saw that the clothes had problems, they called the person who rented them to warn him of the problem and he replied that he would call previous users, but obviously they couldn't change it, so to avoid this kind of problem he said that in the future they will rent a few more clothes, to be sure to have enough in good conditions. 

In order to make us understand better the problem he had encountered, he showed us some photos of the defects found in some garments.

#### Observation: Federica (F, 25, never had experience in rental or shopping simil rental, but she loves flea markets) 
Federica first of all took a good look at the wrapped box, to notice every kind of imperfection. She started open the package, that contained a shoe box, but she immediately became nervous. She started muttering to herself that shoes were too different, with different texture and a wrong size, therefore they would not enter to her. She took her tablet and she suddenly opened the chat with the vendor, to communicate the problem. She tried to find a compromise with him, in order to obtain the refund, but he was uncooperative because she payed a little for them. At this point she were more nervous and she tried to contact someone to solve the problem, so she clicked on the button to signal a problem, make a photo, wrote a description, and sent the complaint. At this point the transaction was blocked, but she was redirect again in the same chat with the vendor, that doesn't want to make the refund. She was angry, and she decided to look for a number to contact some intermediary of the application, but at the end she decided not to contact anyone, leave the transaction blocked with the report of the problem and also keep the shoes, since the seller did not want to reach a compromise. 
Some days later she called us and said that the support team forced the vendor to refund her given the evidence of the problem.

*Federica-She just blocked the transaction due to the difficulty to find a compromise with the vendor.*

*Federica-She was searching with poor results for refund policies.*


#### **Observation: Sofia(F, 25, had already have experience in rental or shopping simil rental)**
Sofia started telling us that she often order using this kind of applications. She also said that her experiences were always positive except one time in which she had some problems. When she ordered  a dress from an Italian private vendor, she received immediately the tracking number but since generally it arrives only when the package is sent, she seemed strange. At this point, she used the tracking number to check the position and she discovered that it was already delivered in France. Then, she contacted both the vendor and the customer service but while the first one said that she had not send the package yet, the second one answered with a default message given by a bot. She discovered that the vendor had a different tracking number so she decided to contact the UPS (the courier) customer service that said that the problem was due to the application but in any case the package would have been delivered in a few days. At this time, she decided to contact again the customer service of the application and after three days she received an answer, this time from a real person who gave the same answer of the courier. At the end she finally received her order successfully.

#### Answers 
***Q: Tell me about your experience in rental clothes or shopping simil rental, for example from apps as Vinted.*** 
-Primiano: This was the first time that I ordered something from Vinted, but it didn't go well, because I ordered a t-shirt but the one that arrived to me was different from description, because color and size were different. 
- Alex: As I said I usually rent clothes for carnival. I've never had a lot of problems but the last time some clothes had some problems, were stained and unstitched. 
- Federica: Very bad experience. I got a pair of shoes completely different from the ones I've ordered, both size and model are wrong. Besides I felt quite turned around by the vendor who knew very well that he was selling something different from what was originally decided.
- Sofia: Yes, I have experience with both buying and selling on Vinted. Selling, in particular, has always worked out pretty well, since I think that the process of selling is simple and intuitive. 

***Q:  If you think there are, what are the positive and negative aspects for you to rental from a private instead of a shop?***
- Primiano: I don't think there are some positive aspects, maybe because this was my first time and it was a bad experience. Maybe if someone has economic difficulties it can be a good solution, but I don't like so much. 
- Alex: In my opinion rent clothes is a good solution because you aren't forced to buy something that you never use again, every time you can have a different dress. Obviously, at the negative side, you never know which clothes will get to you before they get to you, so you don't have a guarantee about quality. 
- Federica: As a positive aspect I could say that you spend less for something you'll use just one time. But honestly I must admit that I've never felt the need, since I'm not interested in having a different dress for every specific occasion. If is really needed, I'd prefer to buy something that I can also use for other future occasions. 
  For sure a negative aspect is that you don't know what you've ordered, both in terms of size and integrity of the product, until you receive it.
- Sofia: I use this kind of applications mainly because it offers a wider range of products with relatively low prices. The main problem is, I think, that as a seller you could be easily subjected to fraud, since the customer service mainly protects buyers more than sellers: in doing so, a buyer could take advantage of a poor description of a product (i.e. lack of details like usury, size or damages) in order to retain both the money and the product. It would therefore be helpful to offer a better support service, which should ensure that a product is in fact not in accordance with the description, and which should also make the return of the product available.

***Q:  Have you ever had some problems during the rental or shopping simil rental? Tell me about your reaction.***
- Primiano: As you could see I was so disappointed, the t-shirt was white instead of black, the size was wrong, it was a different product! 
- Alex: In the carnival context you can imagine that sometimes clothes will be ruined, people use streamers and foam, so often clothes can present problems. We talk to the owner and we find a compromise with him, the fault is of people who don't care about them. 
- Federica: When I saw the shoes I immediately became nervous, both size and model were different from the one I've decided!
- Sofia: Yes. I once tried to buy a dress, but some problems connected to the shipping occurred: I obtained a tracking number, although the package had not been shipped yet. Moreover, the UPS point was not the one I had originally chosen and was located in France. 

***Q: Who you try to contact? How?***
- Primiano: I tried to contact the assistance but they redirected me in the chat with the vendor, so in a certain point, while we were tring to find a compromise the vendor said to me that the transaction was accepted. I don't understand where I clicked, but I couldn't do anything about it anymore. 
- Alex: We called the owner, we rent from him since a long time, so we trust each other. 
- Federica: Not knowing exactly how to proceed, I tried texting directly the vendor through the chat. I then followed the instructions provided by the app.
- Sofia: Firstly, I contacted the seller to report that the UPS point was in France, (which was unlikely since I live in Italy). Then I also contacted the customer service. The seller sent me his tracking number, which was the right one but differed from the one I obtained. Subsequently, since the customer service immediately replied with a bot, I chose to directly contact the customer service of the courier, who told me that the problem was not due to the courier. This was because the tracking code and the label are provided by the application. However, they told me that my package would have been delivered in any case. 

***Q:  Were you able to solve the problem? Talk to me about things that left you disappointed.***
- Primiano: No, I wasn't. I try to contact someone but I clicked on something, it wasn't clear at all. The vendor has too much power, if he doesn't want to find a compromise you can't do anything and you can't solve the problem. 
- Alex: I rent clothes from the same persone since a long time, so he trust me and I trust him, he refund us but obviously next times we try to find some other solutions to avoid to stay without some costumes. 
- Federica: Unfortunately I wasn't. I tried to agree with the vendor for the refund but he suddenly stopped texting me back. Besides I wasn't able to understand from the app whether the payment will be completed or not, leaving the transaction blocked.
- Sofia: I expected the app customer service to be more active in the client support, since the operator replied only after three days. 

***Q: How important is it in your opinion to try on clothes before renting them? Why?***
- Federica: For second hand clothes I believe It's very important since I can physically see and touch what I'm going to rent or buy and eventually decide if it fits well and it's worth taking it. Indeed in physical shops, the majority of times, clothes I try don't fit well. But I can say that I've never had unpleasant surprises once I bought them.

***Q: Have you ever had experience with people who speak a different language than yours? How were you able to communicate with them?***
- Sofia: I usually choose Italian vendors, so i had never have this problem, but i know that this application has an automatic and simultaneously translator.
 
***Q: Is there something else we didnâ€™t ask you that you want to talk about?***
- Federica: Another point that I want to highlight is the fact that i see in the policies that if I want to return the product I have to pay the shipment but if it is not my fault it is unfair. I'd like that the vendor is forced to pay for it. 
- Others: No information added.

## User Needs
- Knowledge of return and refund policies.
- **Have the possibility to contact a real customer service.**
- Fairness in advertisements in terms of photos and descriptions.
- **To know how you fit with different dresses of different brands.**
- Not being limited in the usage of the product by the fear of ruin it.

## Project Description
Having observed how the users deal with a problematic order we decided to focus on the user needs "To know how you fit with different dresses of different brands" and "Have the possibility to contact a real customer service".
We would like to help the user in the process of renting clothes in order to make him more confident to select and find the right product, supporting him with different sizes from different brands for example with a size guide. In any case if the user faces some problems he should have the possibility to solve them easily weather consulting the FAQ, contacting the vendor or a customer service through its own smartphone.
