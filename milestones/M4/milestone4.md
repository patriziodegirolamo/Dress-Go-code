# Milestone 4: Usability Testing - [Dress&Go]

## Overview and Script
In order to perform the evaluation, we first of all involved four potential users (Sara, Carmelo, Matteo, Carlo). Each of them is between 18 and 30 years old (predetermined range), is confident with smartphone's use and has no particular experience in renting or refunds.
One of us performed the "facilitator" role (a different group member for each test), while the other ones observed and took notes. 

We identified 7 different tasks that better highlighited all functionalities of Dress&Go app and we decided the methodology and criterias to follow. We have choosen the think-aloud methodology for some tasks and the cooperative evaluation for other ones that required an interaction with the facilitator (for example the chat is not real implemented, so to contacting the renter or the customer service the answer to the message is giving by us, the registration process is skipped so an explanation about known sizes is necessary etc).
As criterias we used the time that a partecipant requires to complete the task, but also the successful task completion for the ones that requires personal choices (for example which product the user wants to rent, or which known size the user wants to add etc). 
At this point we were ready to conduct the usability testing and at the end of the evaluation of each task we proposed a Post Task Questionnaire (SEQ) to the partecipant. 
We proposed them the script to explain the activity, and they solved the 7 tasks after the presentation of the scenario related to each one (scenarios are descripted in the script). 
As last point we drawn up the usability testing script. 

The complete Usability Testing Protocol (with script and Post Task Questionnaire) is avaliable ![here](https://github.com/polito-hci-2021/Dress-Go/blob/main/M4/DressAndGo_script.pdf). 

## Results and List of Changes

[Report the results from the evalation. In particular, summarize the results and findings (along with the most significant photos/sketches with captions), any relevant pain points and/or successful tasks, along with a brief discussion about what you discovered and learned about your prototype.

**TASK 1: Choose a product that you would like to rent and rent it**
- Sara: she opened the applications and said to herself that she needs a skirt for a graduation. She began to navigate the application and searched some sort buttons but there weren't. After she found a skirt that she likes she looked the size guide and she decided to rent it. When she entered in the page of the ads she tried to rent directly the product but the button was disabled because she did not defined the rental dates yet. Then she selected the dates and rent the skirt. 
- Carmelo: he started looking for a jacket, so he entered in the category page and he observed the suggested products, asking to himself if the suggestion was based on the size or on the price. Sliding the page he reached the "ALL SIZE" part and he understood that the suggestion was by size, so he chose a suggested product to be sure about it. Then, he entered in the ads page, selected the dates and rented the jacket withour any problems. 
- Matteo: rented the shirt that he chose without any particular problems and in a reasonable amount of time.
- Carlo: he wanted to rent an Off-White product so he used the search bar inserting the name of the brand. He didn't find any products corresponding to the search query, so he decided to rent a t-shirt and navigated in the "T-shirts" category, finding an Off-White one that wasn't reached during the use of the searchbar. At this point he rent the t-shirt without any other problems.

After completing the questionnaire relating to this task, we found that the average result was:
1) 4-somewhat easy
2) 5-extremely important 
3) 4-very familiar

- Carmelo: he used the bottom bar to reach the correct page, but he was looking for the order that he has just made, so he looked for a button to filter rents by the status. There wasn't so he slided the page until he found it. This task required less than 30 seconds so it was successfully completed.  
- Matteo: immediately discovered the "My rents" page present in the bottom bar. Once on the page he had trouble understanding the different meanings of the status of the rents. Thus he decided to consult the FAQ and he completed the task.

- Carmelo: he tried to make a return of the product that he has just rented, he pressed the "Contact the renter" button and sended a message. The facilitator took part as the renter and answered that he cannot do nothing, so Carmelo contacted the Customer Service. The CS (again, the facilitator himself) reminded him that the rent had a status that doesn't accept a return procedure, so he change rent, contact again the customer service and unlock the return procedure.

**GENERAL SUMMARY**

The usability test allowed us to discover some critical points and some improvements that may result in a better usability experience of our app. One of the most common problems that users have raised regards the possibility to handle known sizes in a more efficient and faster way. This is also due to the fact that we have not implemented the registration phase in which we have provided splash screens to introduce the user to the use and functionality of the application.
Another common problem was the difficulty in returning the faulty product. Because of the necessary presence of a real person on the other side (both in the case of the custoemr service and in the case of the renter) we simulated the unlocking of the return button after sending a message to the CS and this was not very clear.
Through these tests we also discovered minor usability issues that we planned to change before the final release.
Apart from these more significant problems, the testing of the application went well, receiving happiness and interest in the interaction with it.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

According to what users suggested during and after the usability testing we have drawn up a list of potential changes that we thought may improve the usability experience of our app and we decided to implement them. 
In particular we have:

-introduced a shortcut to better handle the known sizes: now the user can reach the "Handle known sizes" page directly from the order summary, through a button "Add known size".  

-fixed the issues regarding the database, now the pop-up that appears button shows the right title "Contact the renter". 

-improved the search of products introducing the research by brands.

-introduced the sort button and adjusted the filter button visualization.

-inserted a feedback before renting a product about the rental dates. If the user has not selected any dates a notice "Select the dates before proceed" appears, while if the user already selected the dates a notice "Date selected. You can proceed with the rental!" appears.

-changed "SUGGESTED" with "SUGGESTED BY YOUR SIZE", with an information button "i" that explains the meaning of these two sections.

-inserted a filter by status in "My rents". 

-inserted an information button "i" next to the "Return product" button in order to inform the user that a product can be returned only if the status of the rental is "ARRIVED".
