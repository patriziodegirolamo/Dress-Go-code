# Milestone 3: Wireframe - [Dress&Go]

## Wireframe

The following two images were created using the framework Balsamiq and they respectively represent:
- The homepage of the application where the user can directly search a specific product using the searchbar or choose the category according to the gender selected on the top of the page.
- the page shows the selected category(in this case t-shirts) with the products suggested by user's and known sizes and all products without any filter.

According to the milestestone 2, we decided to add a bottom bar in order to better navigate the site and to solve the problem emerged by the heuristic evaluation during with the user could not reach 'My rents' page.

We decided to represent as second page  the 'category page' to show how we solved the problem of the guide size. This is a very important feature of our application that aims to prevent possible mistakes due to different vestibility of each brand, thus reducing returns and refunds. We proposed a suggested list of products based on known sizes that user may insert to record sizes of brands that he already knows that fit him perfectly.
