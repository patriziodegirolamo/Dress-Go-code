    <Accordion.Header>How to order</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        With the Dress & Go app ordering won't be a problem.
        You just have to follow very few and simple steps. 
        Once you have found the t-shirt of your dream for your very special occasion, check if it fits you perfectly using the size guide.
        Then select the starting and ending date of your rent, checking the availability on the calendar.
        Finally press the "Rent" button and a small recap of your imminent order will appear on the screen. 
        You can confirm or reject it.
        That's it. Inside your package you will receive the "Shipment label" to give the product back at the end of the rent.
        If you have any problems you can contact our customer service or the renter himself at any time!

    <Accordion.Header >How to make a return in case of problems</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          <p>
       For any problems with your rent you can anytime ask for the return of the product.
       The status of the order must be "Arrived".
       All you have to do is to navigate to your "My Rents" page, easily accessible through the bottom navigation bar.
       Here all your orders will appear.
       After choosing the order that you want to return you have two possibilities:
       </p>
       <p>
        - you can contact the renter pressing the button "Contact the renter", show your problem and make a deal with him. 
          In this case he will unlock the "Return Procedure" in advance and you can make a deal with him for shipment costs;
        </p>
        <p>
        - you can contact the Customer Service pressing the button "Contact customer service", show your problem and if the operator recognizes the same problem (you have to give photos or
          an accurate description of the problems) you have the "Return Procedure" unlocked in advance. If the customer service deems that the return is due to an error by the renter, the shipping costs 
          will be credited to his account. Otherwise they will be at your expense. 
          </p>
          <p>
       By pressing the "Return Procedure" button, unlocked by the renter or by the customer service, you can finally print the return label to attach to the product you want to return back.
       When the product arrives at destination, you will obtain a refund.
