        With the Dress & Go app ordering won't be a problem.
        You just have to follow very few and simple steps. 
        Once you have found the t-shirt of your dream for your very special occasion, check if it fits you perfectly using the size guide.
        Then select the starting and ending date of your rent, checking the availability on the calendar.
        Finally press the "Rent" button and a small recap of your imminent order will appear on the screen. 
        You can confirm or reject it.
        That's it. Inside your package you will receive the "Shipment label" to give the product back at the end of the rent.
        If you have any problems you can contact our customer service or the renter himself at any time!
