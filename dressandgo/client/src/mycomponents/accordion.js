          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              For any problems with your rent you can anytime ask for the return of the product.
              The status of the order must be "Arrived".
              All you have to do is to navigate to your "My Rents" page, easily accessible through the bottom navigation bar.
              Here all your orders will appear.
              After choosing the order that you want to return you have two possibilities:
            </p>
            <p>
              - you can contact the renter pressing the button "Contact the renter", show your problem and make a deal with him.
              In this case he will unlock the "Return Procedure" in advance and you can make a deal with him for shipment costs;
            </p>
            <p>
              - you can contact the Customer Service pressing the button "Contact customer service", show your problem and if the operator recognizes the same problem (you have to give photos or
              an accurate description of the problems) you have the "Return Procedure" unlocked in advance. If the customer service deems that the return is due to an error by the renter, the shipping costs
              will be credited to his account. Otherwise they will be at your expense.
            </p>
            <p>
              By pressing the "Return Procedure" button, unlocked by the renter or by the customer service, you can finally print the return label to attach to the product you want to return back.
              When the product arrives at destination, you will obtain a refund.
